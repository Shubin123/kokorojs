# largely inspired by what is acheived on hexgrad.com but with the different model (kokoro82m https://huggingface.co/hexgrad/Kokoro-82M/discussions/25)

# to use this project you will need to provide kokoro_v0_19.onnx file and put it in the project root.
kokoro-v0_19.onnx can be split up into chunks to be more easily loaded
# then run split.js (i used node runtime)

# demo on (https://shubinwang.com/tts)

# project will soon be deprecated as mainline npm package is available through https://github.com/hexgrad/kokoro
